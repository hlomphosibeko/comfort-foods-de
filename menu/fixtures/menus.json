            "content": "Chicken feet are cooked and eaten in many countries. After an outer layer of hard skin is removed, most of the edible tissue on the feet consists of skin and tendons, with no muscle. This gives the feet a distinct gelatinous texture different from the rest of the chicken meat. In South Africa, chicken feet are mainly eaten in townships in all nine provinces, where they are known as 'moatwana or amanqina' (together with the head, intestine, hearts and giblets), 'runaways', and 'Amanqina' (in isiXhosa). The feet are submerged in hot water, so the outer layer of the skin can be removed by peeling it off, and then covered in seasonings and grilled. The name 'chicken dust' derives from the dust chickens create when scratching the ground with their feet. They are often eaten as a snack.",
