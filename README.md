# Comfort Foods.de

Comfort Foods.de is a Restaurant Booking System. The site is for a restaurant that sells South African Food and it is based in Europe. The target market are people who come from Africa that have not indulged in the meals in a long time and also for tourists from around the globe that like to try new food from different cultures. Customers may use the site to make a booking to come visit the store. The restaurant does not allow walk-ins, strictly bookings are allowed. The aim of the restaurant is to allow people from different cultures to experience the warmth and love added into the dishes. The restaurant does not allow online ordering, customers would have to experience the meals inside the establishment.
